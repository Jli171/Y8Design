It has been a work in progress and will be complete on Friday, November 26, 2021. Although the website will no longer be improved past this date, I hope that the idea of informing people about the meanings and origins of their names will continue on beyond my family. The purpose of making this website was to display the origins and meanings of my family’s names and to inform people about what our names say about us. Although names are usually not something we choose, it usually has an intended meaning and use. Names are used to address and identify people, this is the belief in which this website was founded on.</p>

The Old Church Slavonic (or Old Cyrillic) spelling is Їωан. It is the Slavic relative of the Latin name Johannes, corresponding to English John.

Although the website will no longer be improved past this date, I hope that the idea of informing people about the meanings and origins of their names will continue on beyond my family. The purpose of making this website was to display the origins and meanings of my family’s names and to inform people about what our names say about us.  Although names are usually not something we choose, it usually has an intended meaning and use. Names are used to address and identify people, this is the belief in which this website was founded on."
